To run the code:

Rscript Exploratorydataanalysis.R
Rscript naivebayesian.R
Rscript knn.R
Rscript svm.R

Based on all the output, SVM with linear kernel, Naive Bayesian and kNN seem to be pretty reasonable. 

kNN, Naive Bayesian and SVM with linear give similar accuracies. But wih larger datasets SVM might not perform well.

So in my view Naive Bayesian works best for pima dataset.
